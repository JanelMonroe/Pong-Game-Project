Pong game project
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. In the game, players control an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the screen. They compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. The objective of the game is to hit the ball back and forth, with the goal for each player to not miss the ball. 
The left player will use W and S key to move the paddle up and down.
The right player will use the arrow keys to move the ball up and down.
